No path found! There is no async context chain between the two pieces of code you've identified.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the async tree starting at the first point you identified.
In one of the edges, asynchronous context is lost probably due to userland scheduling.
    </p>
    <div id="viz-tree"></div>
    <p>
Here is the async branch that leads to the second point you identified.
Somewhere, you'll need to bind the two together.
